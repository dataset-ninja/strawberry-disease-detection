**Strawberry Disease Detection** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry, and in the agricultural research. 

The dataset consists of 2500 images with 5707 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *leaf_spot*, *powdery_mildew_leaf*, *gray_mold*, and other: *angular_leafspot*, *blossom_blight*, *powdery_mildew_fruit*, and *anthracnose_fruit_rot*.

Images in the Strawberry Disease Detection dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (1450 images), *test* (743 images), and *val* (307 images). Also, the dataset includes ***level_1*** and ***level_2*** tags for test split. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Jeonbuk National University.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
